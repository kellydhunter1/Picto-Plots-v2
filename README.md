# Picto-Plots-v2

## Description

### A movie quiz that uses images to desribe the plot to a movie.

- Picto-Plots was created to showcase my skills to create a simple quiz that utilizes multiple 3rd party API's. Now there is a full interactive way to learn more about me and my taste in movies. 

- Picto-Plots-v2 also allowed me to get gain proficiency with Bootstrap, DOM manipulation, and formatting dynamical HTML elements.

## Usage

There is no installation needed to access Picto-Plots-v2. Follow the link [Picto-Plots-v2](https://kellydhunter1.github.io/picto-plots-v2) to access the application. 

- To complete the quiz, click the movie button that the images represent. If you are correct, the button will turn green and you will see the movie title and a short description. If you are incorrect, the button will turn red. You can guess as many times needed.

- Refresh the page for a new set of images for a different movie.

## Furute Updates

- add movie poster with plot description
- add 'next' button that advances to the next movie
- improve UI so images appear in chronological order based on movie plot (this was attempted and isn't always reliable)
